A clean, tested, **OpenCV-compatible** camera library for wide-FOV (fisheye) lenses — built around the
**Double Sphere** model (Usenko et al. 2018) and a uniform multi-model layer, with analytic Jacobians,
calibration, model conversion, and hardware export. It doubles as a **guided, runnable course** in
wide-FOV camera geometry.

## Why DS-MSP

Fisheye lenses capture a very wide field of view — often **> 180°** — by deliberately bending straight
lines. The familiar **pinhole** model can't describe that, and worse, its `X/Z` projection blows up as
rays approach 90°. DS-MSP implements the models that *can*, and does it carefully:

| | What you get |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Correct wide-FOV geometry** | Double Sphere with the exact `z > -w₂·d₁` half-space validity test — handles the full **> 180° FOV**, not the naive `z > 0` check that silently clips it. |
| **One interface, many models** | UCM, EUCM, Kannala-Brandt (= OpenCV fisheye), RadTan (= OpenCV pinhole), OCamCalib, Double Sphere — plus closed-form **DS⁺ / EUCM⁺** for lenses DS can't fit — all behind a single `CameraModel` contract. |
| **Analytic Jacobians** | Exact closed-form derivatives (no autodiff, no finite differences) → faster, more robust calibration. KB & RadTan match OpenCV to ~1e-13. |
| **Model conversion** | Translate a calibration between models **without images or recalibration** (sample → unproject → LM refit). |
| **Calibration** | Generic Levenberg–Marquardt bundle adjustment for *any* model, with a robust (Cauchy) loss option. |
| **Ecosystem fluency** | Read/write **Kalibr** camchain YAML; OpenCV-style drop-in API; **TI Jacinto** LDC hardware mesh export. |
| **Verified, CI-tested** | 291 tests + import-linter layer checks + mypy, green on Python 3.10–3.12. |

A camera model is a recipe for turning 3D rays into pixels. Here the **Double Sphere** model
runs on a synthetic scene — each world point is traced through its **two spheres** and projected
from the α-centre, painting the fisheye image point by point. One projection ray meets *both*
image-plane conventions at once: the model's **normalized z = 1 plane** (the virtual, upright
image the equations use) and the **physical sensor** behind both spheres (the real, inverted
image). The render's geometry is cross-checked against the library itself (`std = 2e-16`), so the
animation can't drift from the math:

![Double Sphere image formation — 3D points projected through two spheres onto the z=1 plane and the physical sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/learn/double_sphere_pipeline.gif)

The Double Sphere is radially symmetric, so a single **2-D cross-section** tells the whole story —
here the same construction with both image planes labelled (the two spheres lie between the 3-D
world and the sensor, exactly as in the paper):

![Double Sphere 2D cross-section — ray to sphere 1, shift to sphere 2, projection onto the z=1 plane and the inverted physical sensor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/learn/double_sphere_2d.gif)

And the image doesn't have to live on a flat plane. Because a fisheye is fundamentally a map
from **rays** to pixels, those rays can be stored equally on a **sphere**, a **cylinder**, or a
**pinhole** plane — and you can convert pixels between the three with exact, invertible math
(round-trips to **1e-13 px**). The sphere is the *complete* model; the flat pinhole is the
awkward special case that can't hold a >180° view. Watch one real fisheye morph through all three:

![One real fisheye morphing through sphere, cylinder, and pinhole representations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/learn/sphere_cylinder_pinhole_morph.gif)

> *Verticals stay straight on the cylinder; the pinhole keeps lines straight but balloons the
> periphery and drops the polar cone to black — the >180° geometry has nowhere to land on a plane.*

**Is the conversion math actually correct?** The bundled fisheye has a checkerboard with 30 known
corner pixels. We push each corner through the math — `raw pixel → unproject → ray → chart pixel`
— and overlay it on every representation. Every corner lands **exactly** on its checkerboard
intersection in all four images, and round-trips back to its raw pixel to **7e-14 px**:

| Raw fisheye | Pinhole (gnomonic) |
| :---: | :---: |

## Installation

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10**.

```bash
pip install ds-msp                 # core library
pip install "ds-msp[calib]"        # + AprilGrid detector (for the calibration capstone)
```

Verify:

```bash
python -c "import ds_msp; print('DS-MSP loaded:', ds_msp.__name__)"
```

**For development** (running the examples, tests, or contributing), install from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP.git
cd DS-MSP
pip install -e ".[calib]"          # editable install with the detector extra
```

> Prefer isolation? `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` (or `uv venv`) first.

---

## Quick start

A camera model is just two maps — **project** (3D → 2D) and **unproject** (2D → 3D) — plus a handful of
intrinsics. They are exact inverses:

```python
import numpy as np
from ds_msp import DoubleSphereCamera

# 6 intrinsics fully describe the lens (width/height are optional, only for image ops)
cam = DoubleSphereCamera(fx=711.57, fy=711.24, cx=949.18, cy=518.81, xi=0.183, alpha=0.809)

pts_3d = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 2.0]])   # camera-frame points (N, 3)
px,   ok = cam.project(pts_3d)     # -> (N, 2) pixels + (N,) validity mask
rays, ok = cam.unproject(px)       # -> (N, 3) unit rays  (inverse of project)
```

**Want to see it on real data?** With the `[calib]` extra and the TUM-VI download
(`bash scripts/download_datasets.sh tumvi`), calibrate a real fisheye from scratch and match the
published reference:

```bash
python examples/03_calibrate_tumvi_aprilgrid.py
```

## Learn: the guided curriculum

If you want to *understand* wide-FOV geometry (not just call it), the **[`docs/learn/`](https://github.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/blob/main/docs/learn/README.md)**
track teaches it on real public data — every chapter prints a number you can verify. It runs in
two arcs: **Part I — Calibration** (take one camera to a published-grade calibration) and
**Part II — Geometry & 3D** (take that camera out into the world: two-view pose, manifold
optimization, stereo depth).

**Part I — Calibration**

## Using the library

> Full multi-model cookbook (every operation, on every model) lives in
> **[`docs/MULTI_MODEL.md`](https://github.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/blob/main/docs/MULTI_MODEL.md)**. The essentials:

### Create a camera

The model needs **only the 6 intrinsics** for projection / unprojection / PnP. `width` and `height` are
optional — required *only* by image-level helpers (which raise a clear error if missing).

```python
from ds_msp import DoubleSphereCamera

# (a) math-only — no meaningless image dimensions required
cam = DoubleSphereCamera(fx=711.57, fy=711.24, cx=949.18, cy=518.81, xi=0.183, alpha=0.809)

# (b) with dimensions, for image undistortion
cam = DoubleSphereCamera(711.57, 711.24, 949.18, 518.81, 0.183, 0.809, width=1920, height=1080)

# (c) from a calibration result
cam = DoubleSphereCamera.from_json("results/calibration_params.json")

K, D = cam.K, cam.D    # 3×3 intrinsic matrix and [xi, alpha]
```

> `alpha` is validated to `[0, 1]` at construction; keep `xi` in `[-1, 1]` for the well-posed domain.

### Project & unproject (+ analytic Jacobian)

```python
import numpy as np
pts_3d = np.array([[0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 2]], dtype=np.float64)

px,   valid = cam.project(pts_3d)    # (N,2) pixels + validity (correct half-space test)
rays, valid = cam.unproject(px)      # (N,3) unit rays + validity

# Hot loops: allocation-free standalone functions + exact derivatives
from ds_msp import ds_project
from ds_msp.model import ds_project_jacobian

u, v, valid = ds_project(pts_3d, cam.fx, cam.fy, cam.cx, cam.cy, cam.xi, cam.alpha)
# J_point = d(u,v)/d(x,y,z),  J_intr = d(u,v)/d(fx,fy,cx,cy,xi,alpha)
u, v, J_point, J_intr, valid = ds_project_jacobian(
    pts_3d, cam.fx, cam.fy, cam.cx, cam.cy, cam.xi, cam.alpha)
```

### Undistort images

Drop-in OpenCV-style API (`ds_msp.cv` mirrors `cv2.fisheye`):

```python
import cv2, ds_msp.cv as ds_cv

img = cv2.imread("assets/test_image.jpg")
K, D = cam.K, cam.D

# balance=0.0 -> widest FOV (more scene, black borders); balance=1.0 -> tightest crop
K_new = ds_cv.estimateNewCameraMatrixForUndistortRectify(K, D, (1920, 1080), balance=0.0)
img_undist = ds_cv.undistortImage(img, K, D, Knew=K_new)
```

The object API is equivalent: `img_undist, K_new = cam.undistort_image(img)`.

### Robust PnP

Standard PnP assumes a pinhole model and fails on raw fisheye points. The DS solver unprojects to rays
first, keeps the front-facing valid rays, then solves:

```python
success, rvec, tvec = cam.solve_pnp(points_3d, points_2d)          # object API
success, rvec, tvec = ds_cv.solvePnP(points_3d, points_2d, cam.K, cam.D)   # OpenCV-style
```

### Multi-model support & conversion

Calibrate in one model and translate to another **without images or recalibration**:

```python
import json
from ds_msp import DoubleSphereModel, KannalaBrandtModel, convert, Undistorter, solve_pnp

ds = DoubleSphereModel.from_dict(json.load(open("results/calibration_params.json")))

kb, report = convert(ds, KannalaBrandtModel, width=1920, height=1080)   # DS -> OpenCV fisheye
print(report["rms_px"])            # sub-pixel agreement across the image

# every feature works on any model — swapping models is a one-line change
solve_pnp(kb, object_points, image_points)
img_rect, K_new = Undistorter(kb, 1920, 1080).undistort_image(img)
```

Supported: **UCM, EUCM, Kannala-Brandt, RadTan, OCamCalib, Double Sphere**, plus the two
closed-form-invertible extensions **DS⁺** and **EUCM⁺** (below) — all with analytic
Jacobians. You can also calibrate any model (`ds_msp.calib.calibrate`) and read/write **Kalibr YAML**
(`ds_msp.io`). Conversion design follows
[Fisheye-Calib-Adapter](https://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter) (see [Credits](#credits)).

### DS⁺ / EUCM⁺ — closed-form models for lenses that defeat Double Sphere

Two spherical models with **extra invertible distortion stages** for lenses whose radial curve
falls *outside* the rigid 2-DOF Double-Sphere manifold (see the FOV note below):

- **DS⁺** = UCM core + 2-term Fitzgibbon division (θ³, θ⁵) + 2-axis Scheimpflug tilt. 9 params.
  Closed-form inverse (one cube root). Most accurate and the most robust to seed; our default when
  accuracy matters most.
- **EUCM⁺** = EUCM core (`α, β`) + 1-term division + 2-axis tilt. 9 params. **Truly closed-form,
  square-root-only** inverse — no cube root, no Newton iteration — so it round-trips to ~1e-9° and
  unprojects in DS-class cycles.

```python
from ds_msp.models import DSPlusModel, EUCMPlusModel          # or model_class("dsplus")/("eucm+")
cam = EUCMPlusModel.from_dict(json.load(open("eucm_plus_parameters.json")))
```

Both register by name (`dsplus`, `eucmplus`, aliases `ds+`/`eucm+`), satisfy the full `CameraModel`
contract (project / unproject / analytic Jacobian / convert / Kalibr+MC-Calib I/O), and reduce
exactly to their parent (`DS⁺→UCM`, `EUCM⁺→EUCM`) when the extra DOF are zero.

### Choosing a model by FOV (from experience)

A practical finding from calibrating real lenses across the range: **the spherical family
(UCM / EUCM / Double Sphere) can quietly *collapse* on smaller wide-angle lenses (~120–140°) yet
fit cleanly on very wide ones (170–195°).** On a ~140° checkerboard lens here, Double Sphere drove
`ξ→0` (one sphere goes dead) and floored at ~2–3 px; on 170° and 195° lenses the same model dropped
to the detection limit (~0.08–0.6 px) with no trouble. The reason is geometric, not a bug: a
moderate-FOV lens whose radial curve needs a θ⁵ term plus a little decentering sits *outside* DS's
2-DOF curve, while a true ultra-wide lens bends enough that the two-sphere shape matches it. So
"more distortion" is actually *easier* for the sphere models — counterintuitive but consistent.

What we reach for, by FOV band (✅ recommended · ⚠️ works with care · ❌ avoid):

| Model | ~120–140° (small wide) | 170–195° (ultra wide) | Notes from use |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| **RadTan** (OpenCV pinhole) | ⚠️ | ❌ | Fine for mild distortion; the `X/Z` projection blows up approaching 180° — not a fisheye model. |
| **KB** (OpenCV fisheye) | ✅ | ✅ | The dependable conventional baseline at every band (~0.35 px @140°, detection-limited beyond). Iterative (Newton) unproject. |
| **UCM / EUCM / Double Sphere** | ❌ (collapse risk) | ✅ | Closed-form & cheap, but can degenerate at ~140° (`ξ`/`α` collapse). Excellent once the lens is genuinely ultra-wide. |
| **DS⁺** | ✅ (best accuracy) | ✅ | Restores the missing DOF; most accurate (~0.21 px @140°) and converges from a plain seed at any FOV. Inverse uses one cube root. |
| **EUCM⁺** | ✅ | ✅ | Truly sqrt-only closed form; ~0.29 px @140°. At ~140° seed it multi-start; at 170–195° a single seed suffices. |

> **Rule of thumb:** ultra-wide (≥170°) → start with **Double Sphere** (cheapest closed form that
> fits). Smaller wide-angle (~120–150°) → if DS/EUCM collapse, move to **KB** (conventional) or, for
> a closed-form inverse, **DS⁺ / EUCM⁺**. Always confirm with the median reprojection error rather
> than trusting the model class.
>
> *Numbers above are from this repo's datasets (a ~140° checkerboard lens, a 170° `anns` lens, and a
> 195° TUM-VI lens); treat them as directional guidance, not guarantees for your optics.*

### Hardware LDC export (TI Jacinto)

Generate a displacement-mesh LUT for the on-chip Lens Distortion Correction engine (J7 / TDA4):

```python
from ds_msp.ldc import TI_LDC_MeshGenerator

gen = TI_LDC_MeshGenerator(cam)                  # cam built with width/height
res = gen.generate_mesh_and_intrinsics(1920, 1080, downsample_factor=4, balance=0.5)
mesh_lut, K_new = res["mesh_lut"], res["K_new"]  # int16 Q3 displacements + rectified intrinsics
```

> **Best practice:** use the LDC image for the picture, but undistort *keypoints* with the closed-form
> `cam.undistort_points(pts, K_new)` at the **same `balance`**. The mesh point-inverse is exact at the
> center but diverges toward the periphery; sharing `K_new` keeps the two consistent to ~0.1 px.

## Calibration

Two paths, depending on your data:

**1 — The modern, generic calibrator** (`ds_msp.calib`) works for *any* model and is what the
[capstone](https://github.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/blob/main/docs/learn/capstone_calibrating_a_real_camera.md) uses on real TUM-VI AprilGrid footage:

```python
import glob
from ds_msp.calib import calibrate, AprilGridTarget, detect_aprilgrid
from ds_msp.models import KannalaBrandtModel

# 1. detect AprilGrid corners in your calibration frames
frames = sorted(glob.glob("datasets/tumvi/dataset-calib-cam1_512_16/mav0/cam0/data/*.png"))
detections = detect_aprilgrid(frames, family="t36h11")

# 2. turn tag detections into 3D<->2D correspondences (board geometry: 6x6, 88 mm, spacing 0.3)
target = AprilGridTarget(tag_rows=6, tag_cols=6, tag_size=0.088, tag_spacing=0.3)
X_world, keypoints, visibility = target.build_correspondences(detections)

# 3. bundle-adjust from a generic seed (analytic Jacobian + robust Cauchy loss)
seed = KannalaBrandtModel(fx=180, fy=180, cx=256, cy=256)
result = calibrate(seed, X_world, keypoints, visibility, loss="cauchy", f_scale=0.5)
print(result["rms_px"])      # sub-pixel; the capstone reports 0.08 px median, matching the published calibration

**2 — The bundled Double Sphere script** calibrates from COCO-style checkerboard annotations:

```bash
python calibrate.py        # reads anns.json -> writes results/calibration_params.json
python validate.py         # visual reprojection check -> results/visualizations/
```

On the bundled data this converges to `fx≈711.6, fy≈711.2, cx≈949.2, cy≈518.8, xi≈0.183, alpha≈0.809`
at **0.64 px** RMS.

## Deep dive: FOV, validity & undistortion

*A common question: "Why are pixels missing from my undistorted image, even when I try to keep the whole image?"*

### Undistortion modes

Verified on real data (`assets/test_image.jpg`, `assets/test_image_96.jpg`):

| Distorted | Undistorted (crop) | Undistorted (whole) | Undistorted (zoom) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ![Distorted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_distorted_11.jpg) | ![Crop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_crop_11.jpg) | ![Whole](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_whole_11.jpg) | ![Zoom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_zoom_11.jpg) |
| ![Distorted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_distorted_96.jpg) | ![Crop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_crop_96.jpg) | ![Whole](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_whole_96.jpg) | ![Zoom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/result_undistort_zoom_96.jpg) |

- **Crop (`balance=1.0`)** — keeps only center-valid pixels: no black borders, less FOV.
- **Whole (`balance=0.0`)** — keeps all pixels that map to the plane: full content, black borders.
- **Zoom (reduced focal)** — captures even more wide-angle content, shrinking the center.

### Projection validity — the correct condition

The Double Sphere projection `π(x)` is **not** valid for all 3D points. The exact projectability test
(Usenko et al. 2018, Eq. 43–45), implemented in `ds_project`, is the half-space condition:

$$z > -w_2\, d_1, \qquad d_1 = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$$

with the two helper terms

$$
w_1 =
\begin{cases}
\dfrac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} & \text{if } \alpha \le 0.5 \\
\dfrac{1-\alpha}{\alpha} & \text{if } \alpha > 0.5
\end{cases}
$$

$$
w_2 = \frac{w_1 + \xi}{\sqrt{2\, w_1 \xi + \xi^2 + 1}}
$$

This admits points with **`z ≤ 0`** (rays beyond 90°), which is exactly why the model supports a
**> 180° FOV**. A naive `z > 0` test — a common implementation mistake — rejects those rays and
silently caps the FOV below 180°; this library does **not** make that mistake.

<details>
<summary><b>Forward / inverse equations (for reference)</b></summary>

$$d_2 = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (\xi d_1 + z)^2}, \qquad
\begin{bmatrix} u \\ v \end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix} f_x\, x / \big(\alpha d_2 + (1-\alpha)(\xi d_1 + z)\big) + c_x \\
f_y\, y / \big(\alpha d_2 + (1-\alpha)(\xi d_1 + z)\big) + c_y \end{bmatrix}$$

Unprojection is closed-form; with $m_x=(u-c_x)/f_x$, $m_y=(v-c_y)/f_y$, $r^2=m_x^2+m_y^2$ it is valid
for all $r^2$ when $\alpha \le 0.5$, and for $r^2 \le 1/(2\alpha-1)$ when $\alpha > 0.5$.

**Valid parameter domain:** $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, $\xi \in [-1, 1]$.

### The FOV zones

![FOV Zones Augmented](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/main/assets/fov_zones_augmented.jpg)

- **Green (frontal, `θ < 90°`)** — safe for standard pinhole projection.
- **Yellow (side/back, `90° ≤ θ < θ_limit`)** — valid in DS, but impossible to project into a single
  pinhole image (`Z ≤ 0`): a pinhole plane is infinite at 90°, so these pixels have nowhere to go.
- **Red (`θ ≥ θ_limit`)** — mathematically invalid in DS.
- **White stars** — real keypoints, all safely inside the valid regions.

This is why undistortion can't keep a full > 180° FOV: those wide-angle pixels are not lost to a bug,
they are geometrically un-pinhole-able. *(Reference: [projection-failed region analysis](https://jseobyun.tistory.com/457?category=1170976).)*

## Accuracy & verification

Correctness is asserted with **numbers**, not screenshots (`tests/`, `verify_real_samples.py`):

| Check | Result |
| :-- | :-- |
| Inverse projection `K⁻¹` (all undistortion modes) | mean error **< 0.00003 px** ✅ |
| 3D reconstruction of checkerboard corners | mean position error **1.168 mm**; recovered square **20.01 cm** (target 20.00) ✅ |
| PnP + reprojection RMS (real `test_image` / `_96`) | **0.43 px** / **0.85 px** |
| Undistort: object API vs `cv.py` wrapper | identical |
| KB / RadTan vs OpenCV | match to **~1e-13** |

**Conclusion:** the undistorted images are geometrically accurate pinhole projections suitable for
precise 3D vision. Reproduce locally with `bash verify_all.sh` or `pytest`; for the accuracy/speed
numbers above, run **[`python benchmarks/benchmark.py`](benchmarks/)** (e.g. KB vs `cv2.fisheye` to
~1e-13 px; analytic Jacobian ~28× faster per LM iteration than finite differences).

## FAQ

**My undistorted image has black borders?**
Normal for fisheye — a pinhole view can't capture the full > 180° FOV. Tune `balance` in
`estimateNewCameraMatrixForUndistortRectify` to trade border vs FOV.

**PnP fails or gives bad results?**
Use `cam.solve_pnp(...)` (or `ds_msp.cv.solvePnP`), not `cv2.solvePnP` — the latter assumes pinhole and
fails on raw fisheye points. You need ≥ 4 points that are in front of the camera after unprojection.

**What ranges are valid for `xi` and `alpha`?**
`alpha ∈ [0, 1]` (enforced at construction) and `xi ∈ [-1, 1]`. Beyond that the model is non-injective;
the calibrator constrains to this domain automatically. Real lenses sit in `xi ∈ [-0.2, 0.6]`.

**Do I have to pass `width` and `height`?**
No — only for image-level operations (undistortion maps / `compute_K_new`). Projection, unprojection,
Jacobians, and PnP need just the 6 intrinsics.

**How do I use this with ROS?**
Wrap `ds_msp.cv.undistortImage` in a node: subscribe to `image_raw`, undistort, publish `image_rect`.

## Roadmap

DS-MSP is actively growing from a camera library into a small perception toolkit (multi-camera &
camera-IMU calibration, visual odometry on public benchmarks, a C++/Ceres core, inference-only learned
3D). See **[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](https://github.com/Munna-Manoj/DS-MSP/blob/main/docs/ROADMAP.md)** for the build order and design rules.
